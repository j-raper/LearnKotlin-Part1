/*
  - A variable declaration consists of a val or var keyword followed by a name, colon and data type.
  - A variable initialization occurs when a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator (=).
  - A variable declaration and initialization can happen simultaneously on one line or separately.
  - A mutable variable is denoted by the var keyword and represents a value that is expected to change throughout a program.
  - An immutable variable is denoted by the val keyword and represents a constant value.
  - Kotlin can infer a variable‚Äôs type through type inference.

  - Strings are sequences of characters wrapped in double-quotes.
  - A Character represents a single digit, symbol, or letter wrapped in single quotes.
  - String concatenation is the process of joining Strings using a + operator.
  - String templates are used to substitute variable values within a String using a $ symbol.
  - The readLine() function is used to accept a user‚Äôs input via the bash shell.
  - The built-in length property determines the number of characters in a String.
  - The built-in capitalize() function is used to capitalize the String onto which it‚Äôs appended.
  - Character escape sequences allow for the compiler to perform certain formatting operations on a String.

  - The Number superclass contains Int, Long, Short, Byte, Float and Double data types.
  - The arithmetic operators supported by Kotlin include +, -, *, / and %.
  - Augmented assignment operators include an arithmetic and assignment operator used to calculate and reassign a value in one step.
  - The increment operator includes two consecutive plus operators, ++, used to add 1 to a value and reassign the result.
  - The decrement operator includes two consecutive minus operators, --, used to subtract one from a value and reassign the result.
  - The order of operations includes parentheses, multiplication, division, modulus, addition and subtraction.
  - The Math library is inherited from Java and contains various mathematical functions for use in a Kotlin program.
