// First Kotlin Program

// MainFunction
fun main() {
  println("Coding is fun!")
}

// Print Function
fun main() {
  println("Just keep swimming!")
  print(15 * 4)
}

// Order of Execcution
fun main() {
  println("11/2 - AU military goes to war against local emus.")
  println("11/4 - Ambush planned by military fails.")
  println("11/8 - AU military withdraws."
}

// Comments
fun main() {
  println("Howdy, partner!") 
  //Code prints "Howdy, partner!" to the terminal.
  /*The things that I know so far about Kotlin are the main function, print statements, the order of execution, lastly, the comments.*/
}

// Error or bugs
fun main() {
  println("An error a day keeps the programmer away.")
}

/*
  - Kotlin is a general-purpose programming language.
  - The main() function is the starting point of all Kotlin programs.
  - When we want to output something to the terminal, we can use print statements like println() or print().
  - Code is read from top to bottom.
  - Comments are used to explain what is happening in our code.
